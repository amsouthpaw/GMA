      <p class="intro">'Guard My Angel' is a simple application that provides the comfort of knowing that someone will help you if you get into an emergency situation. </p>
      
      <h3>Basic Functions:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Panic Button</dt>

        <dt>Watch Over Me</dt>
        <dd>Click the Watch Over Me button when you'd like our service to watch over you for a duration of time you decide and configure.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>When you are safe and no longer wish our service to watch over you, you can stop the service countdown by clicking the <em>I'm OK!</em>  button and we will avoid sending any emergency notification to your configured contacts.</p>
      <p>If the countdown expires without you stopping it, our service will send notifications to the contacts you configured in your set-up. Notifications will be sent even if the phone is dead or no longer in your possession.</p>
      
      <h3>Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The service requires active Internet connection.</li>

        <li>The information that we keep during the time we watch you will be removed from our server after 24 hours and
        cannot be retrieved.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Auto Emergency Triggers</h3>
      <img src="img/settings-emg.png" alt="emergency settings" />
      <p>Car accidents exert extreme acceleration forces on the phone.</p>
      <p>When you activate the application with 'Watch Over Me' and this option is enabled, we will monitor your acceleration and trigger emergency alert as soon as we identify abnormal forces that are typically observed during car accident.</p>
      <p>We will trigger and alert only when the forces exceed 5G-Force that are unlikely to occur when dropping the phone.
      Enabling this option does consume more battery, but it is optimized for minimal battery usage.</p>
      <p>To Enable/Disable the abnormal acceleration detection you can simply click the <em>Enable Auto detect accident</em> check-box.</p>
      
      <h3>Passwords</h3>
      <img src="img/settings-pass.png" alt="password settings" />
      <p>You can protect your service with a 4 digit password for your safety.
      When enabled, it provides an extra level of security and requires the user to
      type in the same 4 digit pin-code to stop an active session.</p>
      <p>When enabling the password, you will be asked to enter a 4 digit pin-code when you click on the enable box. You can disable it at any time, but if you are in an active session it will require you to re-enter your pin-code beforehand.</p>
      
      <h3>Reminder</h3>
      <img src="img/settings-rem.png" alt="reminder settings" />
      <p>When you ask our service to watch over you for any duration you pick in advance, you will get a reminder 5 minutes
      before the timer expires to avoid false alarms.
      On an android device the reminder will pop up in the status bar, vibrate your phone, and play an audible notification.
      The audible notification can be disabled for your safety if needed</p>
      <p>To Enable/Disable the audio notification you can simply click the Enable audio reminder check-box.</p>
      
      <h3>Personal Details</h3>
      <img src="img/settings-info.png" alt="reminder settings" />
      <p>This section is optional , but It is highly recommended to fill in your personal details.</p>
      <p>The name you choose will be used to identify you by your contacts in the notification list, you can choose any name or keyword
      that will be recognized by the receiver of the emergency request.</p>
      <p>The phone number may also be included in the emergency notification for quicker access to call you back.</p>
